Please read the [Guidelines for Creating Packages](http://mxe.cc/#creating-packages).

In particular, make sure that your build rules:

  * do not run target executables with Wine,
  * do not download anything while building,
  * install `*.pc` file (if applicable),
  * install `bin/test-<pkg>.exe` compiled with flags by `pkg-config`

and `*.patch` files are generated by `tools/patch-tool-mxe`.

If you add a package, you can use tool `tools/skeleton.py`.

Thanks!
